Design an Iterator class, which has:

A constructor that takes a string characters of sorted distinct lowercase English letters and a number combinationLength as arguments.
A function next() that returns the next combination of length combinationLength in lexicographical order.
A function hasNext() that returns True if and only if there exists a next combination.
